              <h3> OVERVIEW </h3>
              <p> When collectors sell works of art, they generally do so through a gallery or auction house. The works are put in the care of - or consigned to - these establishments to be sold to potential buyers. The gallery or auction house receives a commission on each work sold. </p>
              <p> Artsy wants to make it easy and effective to buy and sell art. We partner with premier auction houses and other third parties to remove the stress from the selling process, and to give you access to the highest level of service. For answers to a few basic questions about how to sell art using Artsy, see below. </p>
              <p class="qtn"> What happens once I submit a work to Artsy Consignments? </p>
              <p> Submissions are routed to our network of auction house and third party partners. Our growing list of partners includes many of the top auction houses and galleries across the globe. If you receive a proposal that you like, we'll connect you to the relevant partner, and you'll sign a consignment agreement directly with them to sell your work. </p>
              <p class="qtn"> How long does this process take? </p>
              <p> We strive to get our partners to respond to you with initial interest within 10 business days. However, the length of time between submitting to Artsy and potentially making a sale through a partner does vary. Please let us know when you submit your artwork details if you have a specific deadline by which you are hoping to sell your art. </p>
              <p class="qtn"> Privacy is important to me. Will Artsy keep my identity confidential? </p>
              <p> Yes. We do not share your details until you explicitly tell us that you would like to be introduced to a partner. </p>
              <p class="qtn"> When does my consignment show up on Artsy? </p>
              <p> Your art will only appear for sale through Artsy if the partner to whom you consign offers the work in an auction that is conducted on Artsy. If the partner offers your work outside of the Artsy platform, it will not be publicly visible on our site. </p>
